# microservices
The concept/idea was borrowed from https://github.com/koushikkothagal/spring-boot-microservices-workshop


The movie-info-service has information about the movies
The ratings-data-service has ratings given by user(s)
The movie-catalog-servie takes the information from the above 2 services and merges the data and shows the movie information along with the user ratings.
